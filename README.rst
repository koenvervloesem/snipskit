**Important information: Following the acquisition of Snips by Sonos, the Snips Console is not available anymore after January 31 2020. As such, I have archived this project. If you're searching for an alternative to Snips, I believe that** Rhasspy_ **is currently the best choice for an offline open source voice assistant.**

.. _Rhasspy: https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/

SnipsKit is a Python library with some helper tools to work with the voice assistant Snips_. This can be used by Snips apps or other programs that work with Snips.

.. _Snips: https://snips.ai/

With SnipsKit, you can create Snips apps without having to write much boilerplate code. The simplest example of an app using SnipsKit is the following:

.. code-block:: python

    from snipskit.hermes.apps import HermesSnipsApp
    from snipskit.hermes.decorators import intent

    class SimpleSnipsApp(HermesSnipsApp):

        @intent('User:ExampleIntent')
        def example_intent(self, hermes, intent_message):
            hermes.publish_end_session(intent_message.session_id,
                                       "I received ExampleIntent")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        SimpleSnipsApp()

.. end-code-block

And that's it! No need to connect to an MQTT broker, no need to register callbacks, because the HermesSnipsApp class:

- reads the MQTT connection settings from the snips.toml file;
- connects to the MQTT broker;
- registers the method with the intent decorator as a callback method for the intent 'User:ExampleIntent';
- starts the event loop.

SnipsKit also has decorators for other events, and there's also a class MQTTSnipsApp to listen to MQTT topics directly. Moreover, SnipsKit also gives the app easy access to:

- the Snips configuration;
- the Hermes or MQTT connection object;
- the assistant's configuration;
- the app's configuration.

.. warning:: SnipsKit is currently alpha software. Anything may change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.

.. note:: This project is not in any way affiliated to the company Snips.
